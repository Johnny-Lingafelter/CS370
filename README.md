# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  
  For this project we were tasked with implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm using neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem. We were given a framework of Python code that set up the maze to be used and encapsulated the game experience to be used in the neural network as replays. The code we had to create ourselves was the actual definition of the neural network and the main loop that trained the agent using Q-learning. We saved each move the agent made as an episode, and then replayed the episodes in random order to adjust the Q-values of the network. We also adjusted hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and batch_size.

  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    At a fundamental level, computer scientists solve problems related to how humans interact with computers in an elegant manner. It matters because problems surrounding computers and human interaction are virtually infinte. Computer scientists bridge the gap that stands between what a human can dream and a computer can do.  

  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    When approaching a new problem the first thing I do is try to get as big a picture possible of the system in which the problem exists. Total competency of the problem at hand is an absolute must if the problem is going to be solved successfully and elegantly. Next, I try to break the problem down reasonably into the smallest pieces that make sense, and take each piece one by one. Testing each piece is paramount to make sure each unit is functioning as expected. After each piece of the problem has been solved, integration into a single final piece of software begins.  

  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    Personally, I think that respecting privacy is my biggest responsibility. This includes the privacy of user data as well as adhering to any NDA set in place by the ogranization I am responsible to.
